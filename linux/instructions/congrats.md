Congratulations!
================

You got things working again, and your company is once again printing money hand
over fist. Your boss is going to be thrilled! Remember to ask for a raise during
your next performance review `;-)`

There's nothing else for you to do here except celebrate your accomplishments!
Now you can kick back, relax... orrr, if you're feeling adventurous, try to
break the workshop scoring system in your favor.
